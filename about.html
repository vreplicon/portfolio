          <p class="first">
            Being born and raised in Silicon Valley, I guess you could say that
            I was bred to be a developer. Before I was the age of two, I was on
            the computer playing with my friends Freddie the Fish and Putt-Putt.
            By the time I was in middle school I had made my first little
            programs with Scratch, and by the time I graduated high school I was
            using C and Arduino to program robots and magnetic levitating train
            models.
          </p>

        <div class="container right">
          <img
            src="resources/nasaPoster.jpg"
            alt="Violet presenting a poster at NASA"
          />
          <p>
            During college I tried to tie my love of programming with my other
            passion of astronomy. This led to me having a wide range of
            opportunities including getting the chance to work at both Apple and
            NASA. Having this background has allowed me to pick up many
            different tools in the trade. Not only do I have experience in data
            science focused languages (Python) but also in more software
            development focused languages (Java, Javascript).
          </p>

            alt="Violet climbing up the side of Half Dome"
          />
          <p>
            As I have gotten older, I have learned that to be happy, balance is
            key, so when I get free time I try to get away from the screens and
            get some fresh air. If you canâ€™t find me at my computer, you can
            probably either find me in a tent somewhere or tied into a harness
            climbing some rocks
