                <h1>A little about me...</h1>
                <p>
                    I have and always will love solving puzzles. There is something about the 
                    satisfaction of finding a solution after hours of searching. Every new 
                    programming project I work on feels like sitting down with a new jigsaw
                    puzzle and it is so exciting to see how all of the pieces will work
                    together in the end. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have had the fortune to be able to test my programming and problem 
                    solving skills in many different environments such as Silicon Valley 
                    (Apple Maps) and the scientific community (NASA). Having this background 
                    has allowed me to pick up many different tools in the trade. Not only 
                    do I have experience in data science focused languages (Python) but 
                    also in more software development focused languages (Java, Javascript).
                </p>
                <p>
                    To balance out my tech focused life, I enjoy spending time as far 
                    away from civilization as possible. If you canâ€™t find me at my 
                    computer, you can probably either find me in a tent somewhere or 
                    tied into a harness climbing some rocks.
